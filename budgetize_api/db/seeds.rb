# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# user1 = User.create(email: "red2@wow.com", password_digest: "redred")

# budget1 = Budget.create(amount: 2000)
# user1.budget = budget1

# expense1 = Expense.create(title: "grocery", amount: 90)
